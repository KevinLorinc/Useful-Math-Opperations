# Useful-Math-Opperations
java code to accomplish math operations.

The matrix opperations class will be added to overtime as I continue my
studies of linear alegra. As of right now it can create matricies and
recursivly calculate the determinant of any nXn matrix. This is code
that I came up with without the use of any external sources. It is 
readible but efficiency (due to the recursive nature of some methods)
may be an issue.

The main purpose of this project is educational as opposed to creating the
most optimal method for mathematical opperations.
